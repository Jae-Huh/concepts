**Node.js** is a _server-side_ JavaScript environment that also lets you run JavaScript in the terminal, which is pretty exciting! So far in your projects you have mainly been using JavaScript on the _client-side_ (in the browser.)

**NPM** is a package manager which lets you use other people's JavaScript modules. We don't want to write everything from scratch or we'll be here forever! One of the wonderful things with open source programming is the ability to use and publish code to help achieve certain things. By using modules and libraries we can get to doing the fun stuff faster.

We'll cover this in a lot more detail later this week. Suffice to say it's very exciting and incredibly powerful.

Make sure you're using an up to date version of Node (6.x) and NPM (v3.x):

```
which node
node -v
npm -v
```

Use NVM to keep your Node.js and NPM up to date.
