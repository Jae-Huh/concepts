Agile is an often-misused label for a development methodology that many profess to practice, but few actually implement.


### Why?

Agile's origins date back to the 1970s. People started becoming frustrated with the traditional 'waterfall' model of development:

Another way of describing this model is to think of it as a production line:

 - first we plan, 
 - then design,
 - then implement,
 - then test,
 - then enter a maintenance phase.

Trouble is, often what the finished product actually needs to be can't be determined perfectly during the requirements/planning phase.

> At the end of a project, a team might have built the software it was asked to build, but, in the time it took to create, business realities have changed so dramatically that the product is irrelevant. In that scenario, a company has spent time and money to create software that no one wants. Couldnâ€™t it have been possible to ensure the end product would still be relevant before it was actually finished? ~ [agilemethodology.org](https://agilemethodology.org)


### Scrum

Scrum is the most common/popular approach to Agile development. You can read more about it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">on Wikipedia</a>. Some people use the terms interchangeably, but strictly speaking Scrum is _a kind_ of Agile. Another way to describe it: Scrum is a _framework_ for Agile development. It gives specific guidance on roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master) and the process or order of events. Most of the following content is related to "Scrum-flavoured Agile".


### Team composition

Traditional teams are often siloed: all the management/architects together, all the designers together, all the developers together, all the testers together. Agile development encourages teams to be _cross-functional_: made up of people from many different disciplines. Scrum encourages self-organising teams.


### Iteration

In Agile, we try to incorporate a little of each phase of development into short cycles, often called _sprints_. The idea is to have code that could potentially be _shipped_ (deployed, published) at the end of each sprint. Two week sprints are common.
