One way to represent a feature you'd like your program to have is the [user story](https://manifesto.co.uk/agile-concepts-user-stories/). This is a formulaic description of a 'want' that the user has.


### Format

User stories follow a distinct format:

> As a _[ persona ]_ I want _[ feature ]_ so that I can _[ outcome ]_.

Some examples:

  * As a user I want to login with username and password so that I can access my information.
  * As a user I want to login with Facebook so that I don't have to remember another password.
  * As a user I want to change my profile picture because I don't look like that anymore.
  * As an administrator I can view a list of users so that I can manage my site.


### Why?

User stories divide our programs into discrete 'chunks' that can easily be worked on separately. They help us understand and manage the _scope_ of our work: which features we should add next, and which are _must have_ as opposed to _nice to have_. They also help us to keep the end user in mind: you know, that person we're actually developing all this for!
