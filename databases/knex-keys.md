### A key, you say?

Keys are integral to Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). Each _record_ or _row_ can contain one or more keys, and there are several different types.

Records can be identified either by a single key or a combination of keys. Often, but not always, they'll be numbers. There are two types we'll concern ourselves with for now: **primary** and **foreign** keys.


### Primary keys

Typically your `id` column will be a primary key. They have a _unique constraint_, which means that each value must be unique. You can't have two 1's, three 2's, etc. Imagine the chaos if the users in your database could share user IDs! 

Here's a Knex.js migration that creates a simple table with a primary key:

```
exports.up = function (knex, Promise) {
  return Promise.all([
    knex.schema.createTable('users', function (table) {
      table.increments('id').primary()
      table.string('name')
    })
  ])
}

exports.down = function (knex, Promise) {
  return Promise.all([
    knex.schema.dropTable('users')
  ])
}
```

***users***

| id (PK) | name       |
|---------|------------|
| 1       | basie      |
| 2       | fitzgerald |
| 3       | coltrane   |
| 4       | thelonious |

Primary keys can't be null or 0. Every record in a table with a primary key has to have a key assigned. The `.increments()` function above just makes sure that when you add a new row, an `id` will be assigned with the value of the highest existing `id` + 1.


### Foreign keys

Often we'll need to relate a record in one table to a record in another. Foreign keys link records from different tables together. Using _constraints_, they can help maintain the integrity of the data and enable joins to combine tables.

Here's how Knex defines foreign keys:

```
exports.up = function (knex, Promise) {
  return Promise.all([
    knex.schema.createTable('dogs', function (table) {
      table.increments('id').primary()
      table.string('name')
      table.integer('breed_id').references('breeds.id')
    }),
    knex.schema.createTable('breeds', function (table) {
      table.increments('id').primary()
      table.string('name')
    })
  ])
}

exports.down = function (knex, Promise) {
  return Promise.all([
    knex.schema.dropTable('dogs'),
    knex.schema.dropTable('breeds')
  ])
}
```

Notice the `.references('breeds.id')`? That tells the database that we want `dogs.breed_id` to refer to `breeds.id`: we're linking the two tables together using `breed_id` as the key.

***dogs***

| id (PK) | name   | breed_id (FK) |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| 1       | Daisy  | 3             |
| 2       | Clarry | 2             |

***breeds***

| id (PK) | name    |
|---------|---------|
| 1       | Boxer   |
| 2       | Spoodle |
| 3       | Mutt    |

Put another way, `breed_id` is a foreign key that references `id` on the `breeds` table.


### Constraints

We've touched on the _unique constraint_ that applies to primary keys (no two can be the same value). Foreign keys can have constraints too, that define what should happen when an attempt is made to remove or alter the record that the key is pointing to.

Take the above table for example. Say someone tries to delete the 'Mutt' row in the `breeds` table, with `id` 3. We already have a record that refers to that row: 'Daisy' in `dogs` would be left without a breed! This seems like a bad thing, and it is. We don't want IDs that point off into nowhere, referring to no record. If someone later managed to add a completely different breed having an `id` of 3, Daisy's breed would be changed without anyone asking her permission.

The solution is to add a constraint defining what should happen if a breed is deleted. We call this constraint _ON DELETE_. There are several possible values for the constraint. Two of the most important are _RESTRICT_ and _CASCADE_. 

RESTRICT means that the attempt to remove the 'Mutt' record will _fail_ if any of the records in the `dogs` table are mutts. Each dog would have to have their breed changed before the attempt to delete 'Mutt' could succeed.

CASCADE means that all dogs that are mutts will be deleted when the 'Mutt' record is deleted! For obvious reasons, be careful with this one.

We can also apply similar values to an _ON UPDATE_ constraint, which as you might have guessed defines what the database should do when a record in `breeds` is changed, but not deleted.

Here's how Knex handles these constraints:

```
  table.integer('breed_id')
    .references('breeds.id')
    .onDelete('RESTRICT')
    .onUpdate('CASCADE')
```

In other words, when someone tries to remove a breed that is referenced in `dogs`, don't allow it; when someone merely updates a breed, the change spreads to all dogs of that breed. For example, if 'Mutt's `id` was changed from 3 to 4, Daisy's `breed_id` would change to 4 as well.
