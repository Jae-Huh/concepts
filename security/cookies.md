A [cookie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie) is a small textfile which your browser stores and sends to the server on every HTTP request.
Sessions are built on top of cookies which is why you might have seen messages like 'you must have cookies enabled to login to this website'.
When using sessions you won't need to use cookies directly, though it is important you understand how they work.
To interact with cookies directly checkout the [Cookie parser middleware](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser).
