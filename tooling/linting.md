Software projects commonly require developers to write code that conforms to a specific style. A style guide specifies how the code should be formatted, often in excrutiating detail. Writing code that conforms to a style guide has the following advantages and is strongly recommended:
 * Code written by someone else that conforms a familiar style will be more readable than code that does not * Your brain has powerful pattern matching capabilities - if the code is well-formatted and in a familiar style you will be able to spot errors **much faster** than if it wasn't well-formatted.
 * Style guides have rules that catch common bugs
 * Developers use tools to automate the process of formatting and checking code to see if it conforms to a style (linting).
