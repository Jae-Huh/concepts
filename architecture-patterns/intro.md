A full-stack application is one that uses the potential capabilities of the client and the server. View composition can happen on either the client or the server and data can either be retrieved from the database, an API call to the application server or an API call to an external third party service (Twitter). There are a number of different scenarios that could be considered "full-stack". Regardless of the scenario, there are a number of components that are consistent. We're going to assign each of these components and roleplay a number of the common scenarios.

 - Backend API Service
 - Frontend API Consumer
 - Frontend template Renderer
