The web is a subset the wider internet. The parts, roughly speaking, are web sites you can visit with your browser. Examples of things on the internet that are not on the web:

Protocols are agreements that define how different computers communicate with each other. For example:

 - TCP/IP (transmission control protocol/internet protocol)
 - VOIP (voice over internet protocol)
 - HTTP (hypter text transer protocol)
 - FTP (file transer protocol)

DNS, the Domain Name Service, defines how domain names, such as devacademy.co.nz, are resolved to IP addresses, such as 12.57.211.43. This resolution is required before the computers are able to communicate with each other.
