A `get` requests is a _read_ operation, and read operations shouldn't have _side effects_ - meaning, nothing should change as the result of just reading it. If you're sending data to the server, you most likely want there to be side effects. That's fine, you should just be more explicit in your intent - by using `post`. There are a lot of _shoulds_ in this paragraph. These are motivated by being a good HTTP citizen and using the protocol the way it was intended. It is certainly possible to write `get` requests that have side effects, but adhering to this guidance will help you maintain expectations with other developers and illustrate your appreciation for the HTTP specification and its authors. This guidance will become even more important when we learn about REST web APIs.
