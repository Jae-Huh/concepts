The 4 most common HTTP requests (also called _verbs_ and _methods_) are:

* GET: asks for and existing resource
* POST: sends data to create a new resource
* PUT: sends data to update existing resource
* DELETE: asks for an existing resource to be deleted

There are a few other HTTP verbs, but these are the important ones for now.
