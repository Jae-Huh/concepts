# Cucumber Tests

Cucumber tests are flavour of integration tests that aim to improve collaboration between technical and non-technical people in developing software. 

The significant features of cucumber testing are:
  * Tests are human readable - people without technical understanding can participate directly in reading and writing tests
  * Tests are written in [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference) which:
  * clarifies what the software should do from a user's perspective, and
  * follows a familiar pattern analogous to that of unit testing:  Given (arrange), When (act) Then (assert), and 
  * can be linked directly to the the team and client's broader intentions for the software such as User Stories or [Jobs-to-be-done](https://blog.intercom.io/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/) 


A Behaviour Driven Development cycle that uses Cucumber might follow the following steps:


## Intention clarification (user stories / jobs to be done)

## Feature specification

## App scaffolding

## Cucumber automation

## Development

## Passing integration tests

## Acceptance tests
