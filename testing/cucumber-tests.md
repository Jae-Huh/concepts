# Cucumber Tests

Cucumber tests are flavour of integration tests that aim to improve collaboration between technical and non-technical people in developing software. 

The significant features of cucumber testing are:
  * Tests are human readable - people without technical understanding can participate directly in reading and writing tests
  * Tests are written in [Gherkin syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/reference) which:
  * clarifies what the software should do from a user's perspective, and
  * follows a familiar pattern analogous to that of unit testing:  Given (arrange), When (act) Then (assert), and 
  * can be linked directly to the the team and client's broader intentions for the software such as User Stories or [Jobs-to-be-done](https://blog.intercom.io/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/) 


A Behaviour Driven Development cycle that uses Cucumber might follow the following steps:


## Intention clarification (user stories / jobs to be done)

At this stage the client and software team clarify the problems that the user faces or the jobs that the software will help them perform. 

For example, a weather app we may define a User Story as the following:

```yml
As a User,
I want to View the Rain Likelihood for my GPS coordinates
So that, when I go outside I know whether I need to take my jacket

```
