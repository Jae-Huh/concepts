We can send 'fake' data to our POST routes to check that the response is what we expect.

We _could_ do this manually, by entering data into a form on a browser. However, we don't need to do this and it's probably better not to. We want to test in a way that's _automated_ and _repeatable_. We'll use [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest) to do our POST route testing.

> Strictly speaking, this kind of test is not a _unit test_: we are testing our server, starting from the point where it receives a request to the moment it sends a response back to the client. Some tests involve more than one 'unit' of code, and they often follow the same path as a user making a request from the browser... we're just skipping the browser part!


### Example: checking for confirmation

Say we have a route that renders a Handlebars template and returns HTML confirming the form submission. We could test this like so:

```js
var test = require('tape')
var request = require('supertest')
var cheerio = require('cheerio')

test("POST '/' returns confirmation including name", function (t) {
  // Arrange
  var formData = {
    name: 'flargle',
    address: '1 Flargle Lane'
  }
  var expected = 'Your submission was accepted, ' + formData.name

  // Act
  request(app)
    .post('/')
    .type('form')
    .send(formData)
    .end(function (err, res) {
      var $ = cheerio.load(res.text)
      var actual = $('body').html()

      // Assert
      t.error(err)
      t.ok(actual.includes(expected))
      t.end()
    })
})
```

There's quite a bit going on in this example! Let's break down some of the major points to note:

 - We use `request.post` to specify the route we wish to test
 - We use `request.type` to specify that the data we're sending is a form
 - We use `request.send` to send the data, which Supertest will automatically convert to form fields
 - We only do our _assertions_ in the callback (the function passed to `request.end`. This is a test for _asynchronous_ code, so we need to wait for it to call the callback before we check any values.

We use [cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) because the route is sending back HTML, and cheerio makes it easier to find the values we're looking for. Obviously, this wouldn't work so well if the route sent us a JSON or plain text response.

Notice also that we're using the JavaScript string prototype function `.includes`, which returns a boolean. This is because the template often will contain extraneous characters like newlines and white space, which we're not really interested in but might make our test fail. For example:

```shell
    âœ– should be equal
    ------------------
      operator: equal
      expected: 'Your submission was accepted, flargle'
      actual:   '\n    Your submission was accepted, flargle\n  '
```

The route is obviously doing what it's told, but strictly speaking the text is different so the test will not pass. We could also `.trim` the string.


### Example: server-side validation

Sometimes users don't submit all the information they're supposed to! Maybe even most of the time. We shouldn't trust that all data we expect is actually being sent to our route. Try this on for size:

```js
test("POST '/' returns an error when name is missing", function (t) {
  // Arrange
  var formData = {
    address: '1 Flargle Lane'
  }
  var expected = 'Error'

  // Act
  request(app)
    .post('/')
    .type('form')
    .send(formData)
    .end(function (err, res) {
      var $ = cheerio.load(res.text)
      var actual = $('body').html()

      // Assert
      t.error(err)
      t.ok(actual.includes(expected))
      t.end()
    })
})
```

This test looks for the word 'Error' in the HTML body as an indication that the route has returned with a notice letting the user know they didn't provide all the information we needed.

Try writing the route so that both tests pass.
