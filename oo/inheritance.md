Inheritance 

In Object Oriented programming objects can *inherit* properties and behaviours from *parent* objects. This allows us to reuse code from the parent objects. 

When we *instantiate* objects from their class or prototype our objects will have the properties and behaviour of their class or constructor as well as the properties and behaviour of the class or prototype *ancestors*
