## Purpose

Many developers work on side projects as a funnel for both professional development and meaningful play. Some employers (most famously Google) even alot time each month for their employees to work on projects that interest them. It's a great way to cement your understanding of new tools and things we've learned during the first part of the bootcamp.

It's also a good time to explore _how_ you learn. What works best for you? When you're working alone, how can you make best use of the time to further your understanding?


## Tips

 - Explore something you care about. 
 - Build something you or someone you know would love to use.
 - Integrate new tools and techniques as you learn them.

The most impressive apps that have been developed in this phase were built with continuous improvement in mind. First, create a minimum viable product (MVP) as soon as possible. It doesn't have to be fancy! Early MVP is a powerful tool in developing your project. It provides reassurance ("At least I have _this_ done!") and it can help to keep your scope controlled: not biting off too much work all at once! Your MVP should be fairly simple; once you have your MVP, your project can develop in complexity over the three weeks of Phase 2.


## Process

There will be time set aside each week to work on personal projects, but you may choose to use your own time to work on it as well. At the end of Phase 2 everyone will present their project to the rest of the cohort.


## Examples

Here are some examples from previous cohorts:

 - [Trout-trout](http://trout-trout.herokuapp.com/#!/), an app to track trout caught in a lake
(repo found [here](https://github.com/SamSimmons/garyTrout))

 - [Schools project](https://github.com/wishmouse/schools)

 - [Hear now gone tomorrow](https://github.com/KeakOne/hearnow-gonetommorow)

 - [Ki Mai](http://ki-mai.herokuapp.com/users) ([github](https://github.com/tony-luisi/ki_mai)), an interactive chat application to aid in learning the Maori language.
