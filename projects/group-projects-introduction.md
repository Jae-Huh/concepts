Today we will spend a bit of time thinking about how we will build our group projects. You should try to use as much of what you've learned this week in your project. You'll have 3 or 4 people on your team and you're expected to partition the work among team members. Each team member may want to choose a task they are strong in, or a task that will solidify knowledge for them. The rest of the team should support these decisions as much as it makes sense. You may also consider designating certain team members as: Time Keeper and Git Keeper (you can come up with your own inventive names for these positions!)

You can use today to establish teams and scope out what you're going to build. A teacher should approve your project idea before you begin. During your planning, you should define milestones and (at a minimum) commit to your repo at each milestone. You are expected to build the appropriate parts using Test Driven Development (branch, red, green, refactor, diff, commit). 

Feature freeze is the time when you are not permitted to work on any new functionality. Code freeze is when you're not permitted to make any more changes to your codebase. Feature freeze is at 3:30 and code freeze is at 4pm. Presentations begin promptly at 4:30. Each team member should speak during the presentation. Each team will have 5 minutes to describe what you've built, show a demonstration, and possibly show one piece of code that is particularly interesting.


### Team dynamics

You've been pair programming for a couple of weeks now, but this is the first time you're going to build something on a team. Be sure you remain mindful during your group project. You're going to be under pressure to finish something under a time limit. You're going to want it to be great and something you can be proud of, and this could add to the pressure. You're going to need to depend on your teammates. Sometimes they won't disappoint you, and sometimes they will. How you react is up to you.

Remember to have **I**ntegrity, **K**indness, and **E**ffort. Be open and honest with yourself and your team. Try to minimize surprises by being transparent. Keep the communication levels high and ask for help when you need it. Focus on setting up your teammates for success.

These group projects are as much about how you work together as what you build.
