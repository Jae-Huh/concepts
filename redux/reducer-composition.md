The reducer we send to Redux's `createStore()` method is a single function that returns the application's state object for any action that occurs within the application. That is a **lot** of responsibility for a single function. The way to keep the application maintainable is to split up the reducer into many smaller reducer functions that focus on a single part of the state. Reducer composition is about taking all of the small reducer functions and combine them into one function called the _root reducer_. Multiple reducer functions can be combined using Redux's `combineReducers()` function.
