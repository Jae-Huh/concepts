MVC is a architecture pattern which has been quite common (e.g. Ruby on Rails uses it).
It's one of several patterns.

#### Views

These are your templates we you use to 'present' our data with.
Views are rendered.


#### Contollers

These are the things which controll what can and does happen to requests when they arrive on the server.
In Express our routes and controller actions are bound together.


#### Models

These are classes which model specific resources, e.g. Student, or User, or Invoice.
Typically, models have an associated database table.
