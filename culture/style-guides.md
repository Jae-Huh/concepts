Software projects commonly require developers to write code that conforms to a specific style. A style guide specifies how the code should be formatted, often in excrutiating detail. Writing code that conforms to a style guide has the following advantages and is strongly recommended:
 * Code written by someone else that conforms to a familiar style will be more readable than code that does not.
 * Your brain has powerful pattern matching capabilities - if the code is well-formatted and in a familiar style you will be able to spot errors **much faster** than if it wasn't well-formatted.
 * Style guides have rules that catch common bugs.
 * Developers use tools to automate the process of formatting and checking code to see if it conforms to a style (linting).

Three JavaScript style guides in common usage are:
  * [AirBnB Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
  * [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javascriptguide.xml)
  * [Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard/blob/master/RULES.md#javascript-standard-style)
