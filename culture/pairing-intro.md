Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work as a pair together on one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the navigator, focuses on the bigger picture, and immediately spots mistakes.

Together, the programmers help each other hold strong attention on the task.

It is a simple but very effective tool.

Watch Fiona and Semira's explanation for an explanation of how to pair program.

Then watch Codr.tv's episode on Pair Programming to hear about how Pairing is used as a tool in the industry.


## Environment

The options we've found for pairing, in order of effectiveness, are:

1. Pair in person
2. Video call while working collaboratively on a remote computer such as Cloud9.
3. Video call with screen sharing (Skype, Google Hangouts, appear.in, etc.)
  **If you can't meet up in person, and you don't have adequate internet connection for options 2 or 3, you won't have adequate communication lines to pair program**

Instead, you can get some of the benefits with:

1. Phone call and slack to discuss approaches, ideas and issues.
2. Share pseudocode and code on slack.


## Prerequisites

* Something to work on together


## When pairing:

  - First, check-in with your pair
  - Assign roles (driver vs navigator)
  - Explain your thinking in a clear concise manner
  - Keep a timer, to monitor how long you have been in a certain role


## Capabilities

You are comfortable:

 - taking time to check in with another person before coding together
 - understanding how to use pair programming effectively
