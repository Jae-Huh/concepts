Being curious about the differences between various setups and tools is a healthy pattern to cultivate. 
It's easy to avoid tools because they sound complex.
Use the skills you've learned about time-boxing to learn about a new tool if you're not familiar with it.
Try it out, maybe copy some code or do a bit of a tutorial, but make sure you get to writing real code as fast as possible.
